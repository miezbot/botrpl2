Api Keys- For the anime, music, and imgur commands to work you have to get an api key.<br>
For logging, please create two channels- `member-log` and `mod-log` for the bot to log moderation history and member join/leave history. 

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository in a folder by doing `git clone <repo link>` in the command line. You can get the repo link from here<br>

* You can also use Github Desktop to clone it or download the `.zip` folder.<br>
2. Change the prefix in the botconfig.json file to *whatever* you want.<br>
3. Do `npm install` to install all the modules in the `package.json` file.<br>
4. For hosting on heroku, just connect heroku with your github account.<br>
- Go to `Overview` and click on `Configure Dynos`. Change it to worker.<br>
- Go to `Settings` and then add the api keys and bot token in the `Config Vars`.
